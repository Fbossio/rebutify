## Context

Important decision because once chosen we won't be able to switch unless we rewrite a lot of code, presumably.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

- Scalability
- Ease of use
- Speed

## Considered Options <!-- optional -->

### Jest

[description | example | ‚Ä¶ ] <!-- optional -->

- Good, because

### Vitest

- Good, because faster than Jest

### No unit tests

- Good, because unit tests in React [aren't good ROI](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/10panfs/comment/j6jr2n4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
- Good, because if we need unit testing we would wait to have specific complex functions to test before we start even thinking about implementing unit tests, which we don't have (yet).
- Bad, because unit tests facilitate refactoring and maintainability. In a team with multiple developers tests are very important to ensure people don't accidentally break functionality.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "[option 1]"  
**Reason(s)**: [e.g., only option which meets criterion | comes out best (see below)].
