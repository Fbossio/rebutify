## Context and Problem Statement

What technology will we use to generate and serve an OpenAPI spec?

## Decision Drivers
- ease of use for front-end dev
- interoperability with tools relying on a standardized OpenAPI spec

## Considered Options

1.  [drf-spectacular](https://github.com/tfranzel/drf-spectacular)

This 2.2k star library is built to "extract as much schema information from DRF as possible".

- Good, because it is fast easy to implement (PR already done)
- Good, because it has strong community support
- Good, because authentication routes also show up in the spec
- Good, because it allows django to serve swagger ui which makes testing API routes simple
- Good, because it allows customizing the autogenerated documentation

2. Vanilla implementation

- Bad, because it would take very long

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: drf-spectacular
Reason(s): only feasible option for our time

## Positive Consequences
- docs in both swagger and redoc UI formats
- new tooling we introduce can consume the docs via the corresponding endpoint

## Negative Consequences
