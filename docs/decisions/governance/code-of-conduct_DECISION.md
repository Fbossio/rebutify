- **Technical Story**:
  - [Your Code of Conduct - (opensource.guide)](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/)
- **Last updated**: 27-05-2024

## Context and Problem Statement

The impact of the code of conduct is low as we do not have a community yet.

## Decision Drivers

1. **Accessibility**: Ensure the document is easily accessible within the project repository and available in multiple languages if necessary.
2. **Specific Examples**: Includes specific examples of both acceptable and unacceptable behaviors to eliminate ambiguity.
3. **Concise**: Easy to read and remember, focuses on the most important points.
4. **Positive Tone**: Describes guidelines in a positive way.
5. **Reporting Process**: Defines steps for reporting violations and provides multiple channels for doing so, ensures the process is straightforward and confidential.
6. **Defined Consequences**: Specify the consequences of violating the Code of Conduct to ensure consistency and transparency in enforcement.
7. **Inclusivity**: Emphasizes the importance of inclusivity and respect for all community members.
8. **Community Input**: Involves the community in the development and revision of the Code to ensure it reflects shared values and concerns.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**:  
Slightly modified default github `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:

1. English only
2. Examples of both standard and unacceptable behavior
3. - Our pledge
   - Our standards
   - Enforcement
   - Consequences
   - Attribution
4. Tone is neutral not positive
5. No steps provided to report violations
6. Consequences are defined
   - Correction
   - Warning
   - Temporary ban
   - Permanent ban
7. Inclusivity emphasized multiple times throuhought the document
8. No community input options provided

**Reason(s)**: A basic code of conduct (heavily inspired by the default github code of conduct) should suffice especially since we don't have a community yet anyways.

### Positive Consequences

- Quickly implemented

### Negative Consequences

- May have overlooked certain flaws
- Will require a full review before future Rebutify releases
